Runge-Kutta enguine for 3D particle simulation in C. Originally aimed to work as general purpouse and I will upload a minimalistic box.c.
This as I was mentioning is at the stage of ploting during simulation with grnuplot. Menu after itertion to modify parameters annd rerun from final configuration. 
Implemented bond interaction and capability to turn the chain in diferent number of points. Soon a better explanation, is under construction.
